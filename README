This package contains an init script for the ftpd-topfield program by
Steve Bennett. It will probably work on all Debian-based distributions, though 
I have tested it on Ubuntu only.

Installation
-------------
Assuming you installed ftpd-topfield, run `make install` as root. This will
install the init script and configuration file.

Configuration
--------------
If the default config doesn't fit your needs, edit /etc/defaults/ftpd-topfield
and set the variables accordingly.
